In React Router Dom v6, navigating to a route with a dynamic segment that contains a forward slash without proper escaping can lead to unexpected routing behavior.  For example, consider a route like `/products/:id` where `:id` might contain a slash (e.g., 'abc/def').  Without proper escaping, React Router might interpret 'abc/def' as two separate segments, causing incorrect routing.

```javascript
// Incorrect handling of '/' in dynamic segment
<Route path='/products/:id' element={<ProductDetails />} />

// Attempting to access /products/abc/def would fail or route incorrectly
```
